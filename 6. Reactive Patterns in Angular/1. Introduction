Reactive Patterns in Angular:

- Handling asynchronous information is a common task in our everyday lives as developers. Reactive
    programming is a paradigm that helps us consume, digest, and transform asynchronous 
    information using data streams. RxJS is a JavaScript library that provides methods to manipulate 
    data streams using observables.

- Angular provides an unparalleled toolset to help us when working with asynchronous data. Observable
    streams are at the forefront of this toolset, giving developers a rich set of capabilities 
    when creating Angular applications.

- The core of the Angular framework is lightly dependent on RxJS. Other Angular packages, such as
    the router and the HTTP client, are more tightly coupled with observables. However, at the time
    of writing, the Angular team is currently investigating making the preceding packages less
    dependent on observables.

- In this chapter, we will learn about the following concepts:
    • Strategies for handling asynchronous information
    • Reactive programming in Angular
    • The RxJS library
    • Subscribing to observables
    • Unsubscribing from observables
