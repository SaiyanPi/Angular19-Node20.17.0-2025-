Passing parameters to routes:

- A common scenario in enterprise web applications is to have a list of items, and when you click 
    on one of them, the page changes the current view and displays details of the selected item.
    The previous approach resembles a master-detail browsing functionality, where each generated
    URL on the master page contains the identifiers required to load each item on the detail page.

- We can represent the previous scenario with two routes navigating to different components. One 
    component is the list of items, and the other is the item details. So, we need to find a way to
    create and pass dynamic item-specific data from one route to the other.

- We are tackling double trouble here: creating URLs with dynamic parameters at runtime and 
    parsing the value of these parameters. No problem: the Angular router has our back, and we
    will see how with a real example.
