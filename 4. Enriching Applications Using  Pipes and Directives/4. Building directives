Building directives:

- Angular directives are HTML attributes that extend the behavior or the appearance of a standard 
    HTML element. When we apply a directive to an HTML element or even an Angular component, we can
    add custom behavior or alter its appearance. There are three types of directives:
    • Components: 
        Components are directives that contain an associated HTML template.

    • Structural directives:
        These add or remove elements from the DOM.

    • Attribute directives:
        These modify the appearance of a DOM element or define a custom behavior. We met attribute
        directives in class and style bindings in the previous chapter. 

- If a directive has a template attached, then it becomes a component. In other words, components are
    Angular directives with a view.
    This rule is handy when deciding whether to create a component or a directive for your needs.
    IF YOU NEED A TEMPLATE, CREATE A COMPONENT; OTHERWISE, MAKE IT A DIRECTIVE.

- Custom directives allow us to attach advanced behaviors to elements in the DOM or modify their 
    appearance. In the following sections, we will explore how to create attribute directives.
