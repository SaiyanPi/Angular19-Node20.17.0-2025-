Listening for events using an output binding:

- We learned that input binding is used when we want to pass data between components. This method is
    applicable in scenarios where we have two components, one that acts as the parent component and
    the other as the child. (product list component is a parent component/ Input is used by the child
    component to receive data from the parent)

- What if we want to communicate the other way, from the child component to the parent? How do we notify
    the parent component about specific actions in the child component?
