Displayiong data from the component class:

- We have already stumbled upon interpolation to display a property value as text from the component
    class to the template:

        <h1>Hello, {{ title }}</h1>

- An alternative way to perform interpolation is to bind the title property to the innerText property
    of the <h1> HTML element, a method called property binding:

        <h1 [innerText]="title"></h1>
    
    -> we bind to the DOM property of an element and not its HTML attribute, as it looks at first sight.
    -> The property inside square brackets is called the target property and is the property of the DOM
        element into which we want to bind.
    -> The variable on the right is called the template expression and corresponds to the title property
        of the component.

When we open a web page, the browser parses the HTML content of the page and converts it into a tree
structure, the DOM. Each HTML element of the page is converted into an object called a node, which
represents part of the DOM. A node defines a set of properties and methods representing the object API.
The innerText is such a property and is used to set the text inside of an HTML element.

ðŸ§ ðŸš€DOM vs HTML
DOM(Document Object Model)
- DOM is a model of objects that represents the structure of the documents.
- programming API for HTML and XML documents.
- it defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
- essentially a tree of objects in memory.
- following is the representation of the following HTML table in DOM

                             <TABLE>
                                |
                                v
                              <ROWS>
                              /    \
                             v      v
                          <TR>      <TR>
                         /   \      /   \
                        v     v    v     v
                     <TD>    <TD> <TD>   <TD>
                      |       |     |      |
                      v       v     v      v
                   program   code  .net   angular


HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)
- markup language we use to represent DOM in text.

                        <TABLE>
                            <ROWS>
                                <TR>
                                    <TD>program</TD>
                                    <TD>code</TD>
                                </TR>
                                <TR>
                                    <TD>.net</TD>
                                    <TD>angular</TD>
                                </TR>
                            </ROWS>
                        </TABLE>

                        
- To better understand how the Angular templating mechanism works, we first need to understand how
    Angular interacts with attributes and properties.
    IT DEFINES HTML ATTRIBUTES TO INITIALIZE A DOM PROPERTY AND THEN USES DATA BINDING TO INTERACT
    DIRECTLY WITH THE PROPERTY.

- To set the attribute of an HTML element, we use the attr. syntax through property binding followed
    by the attribute name. For example, to set the aria-label accessibility attribute of an HTML element,
    we would write the following:

        <p [attr.aria-label]="myText"></p>

    -> myText is a property of an Angular component. 
    -> Remember that property binding interacts with the properties of an Angular component.
        Therefore, if we wanted to set the value of the innerText property directly to the HTML,
        we would write the text value surrounded by single quotes:

        <h1 [innerText]="'My title'"></h1> 

        In this case, the value passed to the innerText property is static text, not a component property.

- Property binding in the Angular framework binds property values from the component TypeScript 
    class into the template. As we will see next, the control flow syntax is suitable for coordinating 
    how those values will be displayed in the template
