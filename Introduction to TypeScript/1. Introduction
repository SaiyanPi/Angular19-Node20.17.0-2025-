Introduction to TypeScript:

- As we learned in the previous chapter, when we built our very first Angular application, the code 
    of an Angular project is written in TypeScript. Writing in TypeScript and leveraging its static 
    typing gives us a remarkable advantage over other scripting languages. 

- This chapter is not a thorough overview of the TypeScript language. Instead, we’ll focus on the core
    elements that will be useful for this repository. As we will see very soon, having sound knowledge of
    these mechanisms is paramount to understanding how dependency injection works in Angular.

- In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:
    • JavaScript essentials
    • What is TypeScript?
    • Getting started with TypeScript
