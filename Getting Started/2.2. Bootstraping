Bootstraping:

- The startup method of an Angular application is called bootstrapping, and it is defined in the main.ts
    file inside the src folder:

        (main.ts)

        import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
        import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';
        import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

        bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
        .catch((err) => console.error(err));

- The main task of the bootstrapping file is to define the component that will be loaded at application
    startup.
- It calls the bootstrapApplication method, passing AppComponent as a parameter to specify the starting
    component of the application. It also passes the appConfig object as a second parameter to specify
    the configuration that will be used in the application startup.
    The application configuration is described in the app.config.ts file:

        (app.config.ts)

        import { ApplicationConfig, provideZoneChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';
        import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';

        import { routes } from './app.routes';
        import { provideClientHydration, withEventReplay } from '@angular/platform-browser';

        export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
        providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }), provideRouter(routes),
            provideClientHydration(withEventReplay())]
        };

    -> The appConfig object contains a providers property to define services provided throughout the 
        Angular application. We will learn more about services in future chapter.

- A new Angular CLI application provides routing services by default. Routing is related to in
    app navigation between different components using the browser URL. It is activated using the 
    provideRouter method, passing a routes object, called route configuration, as a parameter.
    The route configuration of the application is defined in the app.routes.ts file:

        (app.routes.ts)

        import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

        export const routes: Routes = [];

    -> Our application does not have a route configuration yet, as indicated by the empty routes array. 
        We will learn how to set up routing and configure it in future chapter.
