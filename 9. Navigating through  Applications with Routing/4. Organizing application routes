Organizing application routes:

- Our application displays the product list along with the product details and the product create 
    components. We need to organize the routing configuration so that different routes activate 
    each component.

- In this section, we will add a new route for the product create component. Later, in the Passing 
    parameters to routes section, we will add a separate route for the product details component.

- Letâ€™s get started with the product create component:

1) Open the app.routes.ts file and add the following import statement:

        import { ProductCreateComponent } from './product-create/product-create.component';

2) Add the following route definition object in the routes variable:

        { path: 'products/new', component: ProductCreateComponent }

3) Open the product-list.component.ts file and remove any references to the ProductCreateComponent
    class.

4) Open the product-list.component.html file and remove the <app-product-create> element.

5) Run the ng serve command to start the application and append the /cart or /products path,
    click on the Products link, and verify that the product create form is not displayed.

- Currently, the product create component is only accessible using the browser URL, and we cannot 
    reach it using the application UI. In the following section, we will learn how to accomplish
    that task and imperatively navigate to a route.
