JavaScript essentials:

- JavaScript is a programming language that contains many features for building web applications. 
    In this section, we will revisit and refresh our knowledge of some of the most basic ones as they
    are directly correlated with TypeScript and Angular development.

    • Function parameters
    • Arrow functions
    • Optional chaining
    • Nullish coalescing
