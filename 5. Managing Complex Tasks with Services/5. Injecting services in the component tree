Injecting services in the component tree:

- As we learned in the preceding section, Angular uses an element injector to provide services in 
    components through the providers property of the @Component decorator.
    A service that registers with the element injector can serve two purposes:

    • It can be shared with its child components

    • It can create multiple copies of the service every time the component that provides the 
        service is rendered

- In the following sections, we’ll learn how to apply each approach.
    5.1. Sharing dependencies through components
    5.2. Root and component injectors
    5.3. Sandboxing components with multiple instances
    5.4. Restricting provider lookup
