Creating a new angular project:

1) cmd: ng new my-app. (Standalone by default for Angular 18+)

    If you want traditional app with module:

        cmd: ng new my-app --no-standalone

2) Initially, it will ask if we want to enable Angular analytics:

    Would you like to share pseudonymous usage data about this project 
    with the Angular Team at Google under Google's Privacy Policy at 
    https://policies.google.com/privacy. For more details and how to 
    change this setting, see https://angular.dev/cli/analytics. (y/N)

    -> The Angular CLI will ask this question once when we create the first Angular project and 
        apply it globally in our system. However, we can change the setting later in a specific 
        Angular workspace.

3) The next question is related to the styling of our application:

    Which stylesheet format would you like to use?

    ->  It is common to use CSS to style Angular applications. However, we can use preprocessors 
        like SCSS or Less to add value to our development workflow. Here, we work with CSS directly,
        so accept the default choice, CSS, and press Enter.

4) Finally, the Angular CLI will prompt us if we want to enable SSR and Static Site Generation (SSG)
    in our application:

    Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site 
    Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? (y/N)

    -> SSR and SSG are concerned with improving the startup and load performance of an Angular
        application. We will learn more about them in future chapter, Optimizing Application 
        Performance. For now, accept the default choice, No, by pressing Enter.


- The workspace contains various folders and configuration files that the Angular CLI needs to 
    build and test the Angular application:

    • .vscode: Includes VSCode configuration files
    • node_modules: Includes installed npm packages that are needed to develop and run the Angular
                    application
    • public: Contains static assets such as fonts, images, and icons
    • src: Contains the source files of the application
    • .editorconfig: Defines coding styles for the default editor
    • .gitignore: Specifies the files and folders that Git should not track
    • angular.json: The main configuration file of the Angular CLI workspace
    • package.json and package-lock.json: Provide definitions of npm packages, along with their exact
                versions, which are needed to develop, test, and run the Angular application
    • README.md: A README file that is automatically generated from the Angular CLI
    • tsconfig.app.json: A TypeScript configuration that is specific to the Angular application
    • tsconfig.json: A TypeScript configuration that is specific to the Angular CLI workspace
    • tsconfig.spec.json: A TypeScript configuration that is specific to unit tests of the Angular
                            application

- Navigate to the newly created folder and start your application with the following command:

    cmd: ng serve
