Strategies for handling asynchronous information:

- We manage data asynchronously in different forms, such as consuming data from a backend 
    API, a typical operation in our daily development workflow, or reading contents from the local 
    file system. 

- We always consume data over HTTP, such as when authenticating users by sending credentials to an
    authentication service. We also use HTTP when fetching the latest posts in our favorite social
    network application. 

- Modern mobile devices have introduced a unique way of consuming remote services. They defer 
    requests and response consumption until mobile connectivity is available. Responsivity and 
    availability have become a big deal.

- Although internet connections are high-speed nowadays, response time is always involved when 
    serving such information. Thus, as we will see in this section, we put in place mechanisms to 
    handle the state of our applications transparently for the end user.
