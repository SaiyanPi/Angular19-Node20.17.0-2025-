Unsubscribing from observables:

- When we subscribe to an observable, we create an observer that listens for changes in a data
    stream.

- The observer watches the stream continuously while the subscription remains active. When a 
    subscription is active, it reserves memory in the browser and consumes certain resources.

- If we do not tell the observer to unsubscribe at some point and clean up any resources, the
    subscription to the observable will possibly lead to a memory leak.

An observer usually needs to unsubscribe when the Angular component that created the subscription
must be destroyed.

- Some of the most well-known techniques to use for unsubscribing from observables are the
    following:
    ‚Ä¢ Unsubscribe from an observable manually
    ‚Ä¢ Use the async pipe in a component template
