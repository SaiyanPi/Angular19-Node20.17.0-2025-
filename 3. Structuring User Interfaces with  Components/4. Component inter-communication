Component inter-communication:

- Angular components expose a public API that allows them to communicate with other components. 
- This API encompasses input properties, which we use to feed the component with data. It also exposes
    output properties we can bind event listeners to, thereby getting timely information about changes
    in the component state.
- In this section, we will learn how Angular solves the problem of injecting data into and extracting 
    data from components through quick and easy examples.
        1. Passing data using an input binding
        2. Listening for events using an output binding
            -> Emitting data through custom events 
        3. Local reference variables in templates
