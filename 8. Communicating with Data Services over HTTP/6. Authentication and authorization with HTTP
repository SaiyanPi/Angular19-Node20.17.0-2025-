Authentication and authorization with HTTP:

- The Fake Store API provides an endpoint for authenticating users. It contains a login method
    that accepts a username and a password as parameters and returns an authentication token.
    We will use the authentication token in our application to differentiate between a logged-in
    user and a guest.

üìù
A predefined pool from the users endpoint at https://fakestoreapi.com/users provides the username
and password.

- We will explore the following authentication and authorization topics in this section:
    ‚Ä¢ Authenticating with a backend API
