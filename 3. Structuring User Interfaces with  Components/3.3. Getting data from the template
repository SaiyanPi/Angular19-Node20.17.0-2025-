Getting data from the template:

- In the previous section, we learned how to use property binding to display data from the component class.
- Real-world scenarios usually involve bidirectional data flow through components. To get data from the
    template back to the component class, we use a technique called event binding. 
- We will learn how to use event binding by notifying the component class when a product has been selected
    from the list:

    1) Open the product-list.component.ts file and add a selectedProduct property:

            selectedProduct: Product | undefined;
    
    2) Open the product-list.component.html file and use the interpolation syntax to display the selected
        product if it exists:

            @if (selectedProduct) {
                <p>You selected:
                    <strong>{{ selectedProduct.title }}</strong>
                </p>
            }
    
    3) Add a click event binding in the <li> tag to set the selectedProduct to the current product variable
        of the @for block:

            <ul class = "pill-group">
                @for (product of products; track product.id; let i = $index) {
                    <li class="pill" üëâ(click)="selectedProduct = product">
                        @switch (product.title) {
                            @case ('Keyboard') {‚å®Ô∏è}
                            @case ('Microphone') {üéôÔ∏è}
                            @default {üè∑Ô∏è}
                        }
                        {{i+1}}. {{product.title}}
                    </li>
                }
                @empty {
                    <li class = "pill">No products available</li>
                }

                @if (selectedProduct) {
                    <p>You selected:
                    <strong>{{ selectedProduct.title }}</strong>
                    </p>
                }
            </ul>

    4) Run ng serve to start the application and click on a product from the list:

            Products (4)
            ‚å®Ô∏è 1. Keyboard
            üéôÔ∏è 2. Microphone
            üè∑Ô∏è 3. Web camera
            üè∑Ô∏è 4. Tablet
            You selected: Web camera

- An event binding listens for DOM events on the target HTML element and responds to those events 
    by interacting with members of the component class. 
- The event inside parentheses is called the target event and is the event we are currently listening to.
    The expression on the right is called the template statement and interacts with the component class.

        (click)="selectedProduct = product"

    
                          [innerText] = "product.title"/ {{product.title}}
                        --------------------------------------------------->
            COMPONENT                                                           TEMPLATE
                        <---------------------------------------------------
                                (click)="selectedProduct = product"
