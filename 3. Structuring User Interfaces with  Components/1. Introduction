Structuring User Interfaces with Components:

- So far, we have had the opportunity to take a bird’s-eye view of the Angular framework. We learned
    how to create a new Angular application using the Angular CLI and how to interact with an Angular
    component using template syntax. We also explored TypeScript, which will help us understand how to
    write Angular code. 

- In this chapter, we will learn about the following concepts:
    • Creating our first component
    • Interacting with the template
    • Component inter-communication
    • Encapsulating CSS styling
    • Deciding on a change detection strategy
    • Introducing the component lifecycle
