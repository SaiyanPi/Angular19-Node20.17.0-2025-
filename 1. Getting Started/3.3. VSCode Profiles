VSCode Profiles:

- VSCode Profiles allows us to customize the following aspects of the VSCode editor:
    • Settings: The configuration settings of VSCode
    • Keyboard shortcuts: Shortcuts to execute VSCode commands with the keyboard 
    • Snippets: Reusable template code snippets
    • Tasks: Tasks that automate the execution of scripts and tools directly from VSCode
    • Extensions: Tools that enable us to add new capabilities in VSCode, such as languages, 
                    debuggers, and linters

- Profiles can also be shared, which helps us maintain a consistent development setup and work
    flow across our team. VSCode contains a set of built-in profiles, including one for Angular,
    that we can further customize according to our development needs. To install the Angular
    profile:

    1) Click the Manage button represented by the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar in 
        VSCode and select the Profiles option.
    2) Click on the arrow of the New Profile button and select the From Template | Angular option.
    3) Click the gear button if you want to select a custom icon for your profile.
    4) Click the Create button to create your profile.

- VSCode will automatically apply the new profile after it has been created successfully.
    In the following sections, we will explore some of the extensions in the VSCode Angular profile.
