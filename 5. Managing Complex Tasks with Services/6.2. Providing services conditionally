Providing services conditionally:

- In the example in the previous section, we used the useClass syntax to replace the implementation
    of the injected ProductsService class.
- Alternatively, we could create a factory function that decides whether it will return an instance
    of the FavoritesService or ProductsService class according to a condition.
    
    1) The function would reside in a simple TypeScript file named favorites.ts:

        import { FavoritesService } from './favorites.service';
        import { ProductsService } from './products.service';

        export function favoritesFactory(isFavorite: boolean) {
            return () => {
                if (isFavorite) {
                return new FavoritesService();
                }
                return new ProductsService();
            };
        }

    2)  We could then modify the providers array in the favorites.component.ts file as follows:

        import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
        import { Product } from '../product';
        import { ProductsService } from '../products.service';
        import { favoritesFactory } from '../favorite';

        @Component({
            selector: 'app-favorites',
            imports: [],
            templateUrl: './favorites.component.html',
            styleUrl: './favorites.component.css',
            providers: [
                { provide: ProductsService,👉 useFactory: favoritesFactory(true) }
            ]
        })

⚠️ It is worth noting that if one of the services also injected other dependencies, the previous
    syntax would not suffice. For example, if the FavoritesService class was dependent on the 
    ProductViewService class, 
    
    a) we would add it to the deps property of the provide object literal syntax:

        providers: [
            {
                provide: ProductsService,
                useFactory: favoritesFactory(true),
               👉 deps: [ProductViewService]
            }
        ]
    
    b) We could then use it in the factory function of the favorites.ts file as follows:

        export function favoritesFactory(isFavorite: boolean) {
            return (👉productViewService: ProductViewService) => {
                if (isFavorite) {
                    return new FavoritesService();
                }
                return new ProductsService();
            };
        }
