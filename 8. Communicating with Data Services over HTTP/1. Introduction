Communicating with Data Services over HTTP:

- A real-world scenario for enterprise Angular applications is to connect to remote services and APIs 
    to exchange data.
    
- The Angular HTTP client provides out-of-the-box support for communicating with services over HTTP.
    The interaction of an Angular application with the HTTP client is based on RxJS observable streams,
    giving developers a rich set of capabilities for data access.

- There are many ways to connect to APIs through HTTP. In this book, we will only scratch the surface.
    Still, the insights covered in this chapter will give you all you need to connect your Angular 
    applications to HTTP services in no time, leaving all you can do with them up to your creativity.

- In this chapter, we will explore the following concepts:
    • Communicating data over HTTP
    • Introducing the Angular HTTP client
    • Setting up a backend API
    • Handling CRUD data in Angular
    • Authentication and authorization with HTTP
