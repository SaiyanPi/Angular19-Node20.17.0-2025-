Setting up a backend API:

- A web CRUD application usually connects to a server and uses an HTTP backend API to perform 
    operations on data. It fetches existing data, updates it, creates new data, or deletes it.

- In a real-world scenario, you will most likely interact with a real backend API service through 
    HTTP. In this book, we will use a fake API called Fake Store API.

The official Fake Store API documentation can be found at https://fakestoreapi.com.

- The Fake Store API is a backend REST API available online that you can use when you need fake 
    data for an e-commerce or e-shop web application. It can manage products, shopping carts, and 
    users available in the JSON format. It exposes the following main endpoints:
    ‚Ä¢ products: This manages a set of product items
    ‚Ä¢ cart: This manages the shopping cart of a user
    ‚Ä¢ user: This manages a collection of application users
    ‚Ä¢ login: This handles user authentication

In this chapter, we will work only with the products and login endpoints. However, we will revisit the
cart endpoint later in the book.

- All operations that modify data do not persist them physically in a database. However, they return
    an indication of whether the operation was successful. All operations that get data return 
    a predefined collection of items.
