Components:

- Files whose names start with app.component constitute an Angular component. 
- A component in angular controls part of web page by orchestrating the interaction of the presentational
    logic with the HTML content of the page, called template.
- Each Angular application has a main HTML file, named index.html, that exists inside the src folder and
    contains the following <body> HTML element:

    <body>
        <app-root></app-root>
    </body>

    -> The <app-root> tag is used to identify the main component of the application and acts as a 
        container to display its HTML content.
    -> It instructs Angular to render the template of the main component inside that tag.
    -> When the Angular CLI builds an Angular application, it parses the index.html file and identifies 
        HTML tags inside the <body> element. An Angular application is always rendered inside the 
        <body> element and comprises a tree of components. When the Angular CLI finds a tag that is 
        not a known HTML element, such as <app-root>, it starts searching through the components of 
        the application tree.   
        But how does it know where to start?
