Creating components with the Angular CLI:

- In addition to the main application component, we can create other Angular components that provide
    specific functionality to the application.

- To create a new component in an Angular application, we use the ng generate command of the 
    Angular CLI, passing the name of the component as a parameter. Run the following command 
    inside the root folder of the current Angular CLI workspace:

        cmd: ng generate component product-list

    -> The preceding command creates a dedicated folder for the component named product-list that 
        contains all the necessary files:
        • The product-list.component.css file, which does not contain any CSS styles yet.

        • The product-list.component.html file, which contains a paragraph element that displays
            static text: <p>product-list works!</p>
            
        • The product-list.component.spec.ts file, which contains a unit test that checks if the 
            component can be created successfully:

            import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';

            import { ProductListComponent } from './product-list.component';

            describe('ProductListComponent', () => {
                let component: ProductListComponent;
                let fixture: ComponentFixture<ProductListComponent>;

                beforeEach(async () => {
                    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
                        imports: [ProductListComponent]
                    })
                    .compileComponents();

                    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProductListComponent);
                    component = fixture.componentInstance;
                    fixture.detectChanges();
                });

                it('should create', () => {
                    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
                });
            });

        • The product-list.component.ts file, which contains the presentational logic of our component:

            import { Component } from '@angular/core';
            @Component({
                selector: 'app-product-list',
                imports: [],
                templateUrl: './product-list.component.html',
                styleUrl: './product-list.component.css'
            })
            export class ProductListComponent {
                
            }
