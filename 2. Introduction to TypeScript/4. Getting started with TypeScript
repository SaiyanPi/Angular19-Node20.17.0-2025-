Getting started with TypeScript

- The TypeScript language is an npm package that can be installed from the npm registry using 
    the following command:

        npm install -g typescript
    
    In the preceding command, we chose to install TypeScript globally in our system so that we 
    can use it from any path in our development environment. Letâ€™s see how we can use TypeScript 
    through a simple example:

    1) Open VSCode and select File | New Fileâ€¦ from the main menu options.
    2) Enter app.ts in the New Fileâ€¦ dialog and press Enter.
    3) Select the path where you want to create the new file. VSCode will then open that file 
        inside the editor.
    4) Type the following snippet into the app.ts file:
        
            const title = 'Hello TypeScript!';

        -> Although we have created a TypeScript file, the preceding snippet is valid JavaScript code. 
        -> Recall that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides syntactic sugar through 
            its typing system. However, writing plain JavaScript code with TypeScript does not give 
            us any clear benefit.
    5) Open a terminal window and run the following command to compile the TypeScript file into
        JavaScript:

            cmd: tsc app.ts
        
        -> The preceding command initiates a process called transpilation performed by the tsc 
            executable, a compiler that is at the core of the TypeScript language. We need to compile 
            TypeScript code into JavaScript because browsers do not currently support TypeScript 
            out of the box.
        -> The TypeScript compiler supports extra configuration options that we can pass to the 
            tsc executable through the terminal window or a configuration file. The complete list 
            of available compiler options can be found at https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
            handbook/compiler-options.html.
    6) The transpilation process will create an app.js file in the same folder as the TypeScript file.
        The new file will contain the following code:

            var title = 'Hello TypeScript!';
        
        -> Since we have not used any specific TypeScript feature yet, the preceding snippet looks 
            almost identical to the original except for the variable declaration.
        -> The transpilation process replaced the const keyword with the var keyword because the 
            TypeScript compiler uses an old JavaScript version by default. We can change that by 
            specifying a target in the tsc command:

                cmd: tsc app.ts --target es2022
            
            *  we specified es2022, which represents JavaScript compatible with the ECMAScript 2022
                (ES2022) specification. We will use es2022 JavaScript version throughout this repository.

To make TypeScript copiler use the specific JavaScript version by default
i) Generate tsconfig.json

    cmd: tsc --init

ii) Edit tsconfig.json: Find the compilerOptions section and set:

    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "es2022"
        }
    }
