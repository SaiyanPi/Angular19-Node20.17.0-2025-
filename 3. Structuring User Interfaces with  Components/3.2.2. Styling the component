Styling the component:

- Styles in a web application can be applied using either the class or style attribute, or both, of 
    an HTML element:

        <p class="star"></p> 
        <p style="color: greenyellow"></p> 

- The Angular framework provides two types of property binding:
    • Class binding
    • Style binding

- Class and style bindings are powerful features that Angular provides out of the box. Together with 
    the CSS styling configuration that we can define in the @Component decorator, it gives endless 
    opportunities for styling Angular components.

# Class binding:

- We can apply a single class to an HTML element using the following syntax:

        <p [class.star]="isLiked"></p>
    
    -> In the preceding snippet, the star class will be added to the paragraph element when the isLiked 
        expression is true. Otherwise, it will be removed from the element.

- If we want to apply multiple CSS classes simultaneously, we can use the following syntax:

        <p [class]="currentClasses"></p> 
    
    -> The currentClasses variable is a component property.
    ->  The value of an expression that is used in a class binding can be one of the following:
        • A space-delimited string of class names such as 'star active'.
        • An object with keys as the class names and values as boolean conditions for each key. A 
            class is added to the element when the value of the key, with its name, is evaluated to be 
            true. Otherwise, the class is removed from the element:
            
            currentClasses = {
                star: true, 
                active: false 
            };

# Style binding:

- A single style can be set to an HTML element using the following syntax:
        
        <p [style.color]="'greenyellow'"></p>

    -> In the preceding snippet, the paragraph element will have a greenyellow color.
    -> Some styles can be expanded further in the binding, such as the width of the paragraph element,
        which we can define along with the measurement unit:

        <p [style.width.px]="100"></p> 

        * The paragraph element will be 100 pixels long.

- If we need to toggle multiple styles at once, we can use the object syntax:
        
        <p [style]="currentStyles"></p>
    
    -> The currentStyles variable is a component property.
    -> The value of an expression that is used in a style binding can be one of the following:
        • A string with styles separated by semicolons such as 'color: greenyellow; width: 100px'
        • An object where its keys are the names of styles and the values are the actual style values:
            
            currentStyles = { 
                color: 'greenyellow', 
                width: '100px' 
            };
