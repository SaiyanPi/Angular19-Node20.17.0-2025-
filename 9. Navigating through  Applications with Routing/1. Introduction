Navigating through Applications with Routing:

- In previous chapters, we did a great job of separating concerns and adding different layers of 
    abstraction to increase the maintainability of an Angular application. However, we have barely 
    focused on the application’s UX.

- Our user interface is bloated, with components scattered across a single screen. We must provide 
    a better navigational experience for users and a logical way to change the application’s view 
    intuitively.
    Now is the right time to incorporate routing and split the different areas of interest into
    pages, connected by a grid of links and URLs.

- This chapter contains the following sections:
    • Introducing the Angular router
    • Configuring the main routes
    • Organizing application routes
    • Passing parameters to routes
    • Enhancing navigation with advanced features
