Specifying a base path:

- As we have already seen, modern and traditional web applications react differently when a URL 
    changes inside the application. The architecture of each browser plays an essential part in this 
    behavior.
- Older browsers initiate a new request to the server when the URL changes. Modern browsers, also
    known as evergreen browsers, can change the URL and the browser history when navigating in
    different views without sending a request to the server, using a technique called pushState.

HTML5 pushState allows in-app navigation without causing a full reload of a page and is supported
by all modern browsers.

- An Angular application must set the <base> HTML tag in the index.html file to enable pushState 
    routing:

        <!doctype html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                    <title>MyApp</title>
                üëâ  <base href="/">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
                <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
            </head>
            <body>
                <app-root></app-root>
            </body>
        </html>
    
    -> The href attribute informs the browser of the path it should follow when loading application 
        resources. 
    -> The Angular CLI automatically adds the tag when creating a new application and sets the href
        value to the application root, /. If your application resides in a different folder from the 
        root, you should name it after that folder.
