Nullish coalescing:

- Nullish coalescing is related to providing a default value when a variable is not set.
    Consider the following example, which assigns a value to the quantity variable only if the qty
    variable exists:

        const quantity = qty ? qty : 1;
    
    -> The previous statement is called a ternary operator and operates like a conditional statement. 
    -> If the qty variable does not have a value, the quantity variable will be initialized to the
        default value of 1.
    -> We can rewrite the previous expression using nullish coalescing as:
        
        const quantity = qty ?? 1;

    -> Nullish coalescing helps us make our code readable and smaller.
