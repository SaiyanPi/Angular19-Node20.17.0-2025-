Structure of an Angular application:

ðŸ“‚ src folder:
- When we develop an Angular application, weâ€™ll likely interact with the src folder. It is where we 
    write the code and tests of our application. It contains the following:
 
    1. app folder
        All the Angular-related files of the application. You interact with this folder most of the time
        during development.
    2. index.html
        The main HTML page of the Angular application.
    3. main.ts
        The main entry point of the Angular application.
    4. styles.css
        CSS styles that apply globally to the Angular application. The extension of this file depends on
        the stylesheet format you choose when creating the application


ðŸ“‚ app folder:
- The app folder contains the actual source code we write for our application. Developers spend 
    most of their time inside that folder. The Angular application that was created automatically 
    from the Angular CLI contains the following files:

    1. app.component.css
        Contains CSS styles specific to the sample page. The extension of this file depends on the
        stylesheet format you choose when creating the application.
    2. app.component.html
        Contains the HTML content of the sample page.
    3. app.component.spec.ts
        Contains unit tests for the sample page.
    4. app.component.ts
        Defines the presentational logic of the sample page.
    5. app.config.ts
        Defines the configuration of the Angular application.
    6. app.routes.ts
        Defines the routing configuration of the Angular application.
