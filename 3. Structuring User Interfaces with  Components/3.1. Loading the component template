Loading the component template:

- We learned that Angular uses the selector property to load the component in an HTML template. 
    A typical Angular application loads the template of the main component at application startup.

- To load a component we have created, such as the product list component, we must add its 
    selector inside an HTML template. For this scenario, we will load it in the template of the main 
    application component:

1) Open the app.component.html file and move the contents of the <style> tag in the app.component.css
    file.
2) Modify the app.component.html file by adding the <app-product-list> tag inside the <div> tag with
    the content class:

        <div class="content">
            <app-product-list></app-product-list>
        </div>

3) Run the ng serve command in a terminal window to start the Angular application. The command will fail,
    stating the following error:

        X [ERROR] NG8001: 'app-product-list' is not a known element:

    -> This error is caused because the main application component does not recognize the product list
        component yet.

4) Open the app.component.ts file and import the ProductListComponent class:

        import { Component } from '@angular/core';
        import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
    ðŸ‘‰  import { ProductListComponent } from './product-list/product-list.component';

        @Component({
            selector: 'app-root',
            imports: [RouterOutlet, ðŸ‘‰ ProductListComponent],
            templateUrl: './app.component.html',
            styleUrl: './app.component.css'
        })
        export class AppComponent {
            title = 'Chapter3App';
        }

    After the application has been built successfully, navigate to http://localhost:4200 to preview 
    it. The web page displays the static text from the template of the product list component.
