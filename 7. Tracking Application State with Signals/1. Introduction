Tracking Application State with Signals:

- Angular empowers developers to use built-in reactivity in their applications using signals.
    Angular signals are a synchronous approach to reactive programming that efficiently improves
    application performance and manages application state.

- We met signals in previous chapters where we used the input method to exchange data between 
    components and the viewChild method to query child components. The Signals API can be used 
    in different parts of an Angular application, thus, its usage is scattered throughout the
    chapters of this book.

- In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
    • Understanding signals
    • Reading and writing signals
    • Computed signals
    • Cooperating with RxJS
