Enriching Applications Using Pipes and Directives:

- In the previous chapter, we built several components that rendered data on the screen with the help of
    input and output properties. We’ll leverage that knowledge in this chapter to take our components to
    the next level using Angular pipes and directives.
- Pipes allow us to digest and transform the information we bind in our templates.
    Directives enable more ambitious functionalities, such as manipulating the DOM or altering the
    appearance and behavior of HTML elements.

- In this chapter, we will learn about the following concepts:
    • Manipulating data with pipes
    • Building pipes
    • Building directives
