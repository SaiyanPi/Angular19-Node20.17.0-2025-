Building reactive forms:

- Reactive forms, as the name implies, reactively provide access to web forms. They are built with 
    reactivity in mind, where input controls and their values can be manipulated using observable 
    streams.
- They also maintain an immutable state of form data, making them easier to test because we can be
    sure that the form state can be modified explicitly and consistently.

- Reactive forms have a programmatic approach to creating form elements and setting up validation
    rules by setting everything up in the component class. 
    The Angular key classes involved in this approach are the following:
    • FormControl: 
        Represents an individual form control, such as an <input> element.
    • FormGroup: 
        Represents a collection of form controls. The <form> element is the topmostFormGroup in the
        hierarchy of a reactive form.
    • FormArray:
        Represents a collection of form controls, just like FormGroup, but can be modified at
        runtime. For example, we can add or remove FormControl objects dynamically as needed.
