Rendering components:

- The template of the main application component contains the <router-outlet> element, which 
    is one of the main directives of the Angular router.

-  It resides inside the app.component.html file and is used as a placeholder for components
    activated with routing. These components are rendered as a sibling element of the
    <router-outlet> element.

- We have covered the basics and provided a minimal router setup. In the next section, we will
    look at a more realistic example and expand our knowledge of routing.
