Creating our first component:

- Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular application. They control different web 
    page parts called views, such as a list of products or an order checkout form. 
    
- They are responsible for the presentational logic of an Angular application, and they are organized
    in a hierarchical tree of components that can interact with each other:

                                    component
                                    /       \
                            component       component
                            /       \       /       \
                    component  component component  component

- The architecture of an Angular application is based on Angular components. Each Angular component
    can communicate and interact with one or more components in the component tree.

- A component can simultaneously be a parent of some child components and a child of another parent
    component.

- In this section, we will explore the following topics about Angular components: 
    • The structure of an Angular component 
    • Creating components with the Angular CLI
