Enabling routing in Angular applications:

- The Angular router is enabled by default in new Angular applications, as indicated by the 
    provideRouter method in the app.config.ts file:

        import { ApplicationConfig, provideZoneChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';
    👉   import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
    👉  import { routes } from './app.routes';
        export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
            providers: [
                provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),
            👉  provideRouter(routes)
            ]
        };

📝
In applications built with older versions of the Angular framework, the router is enabled by
importing the RouterModule class in the main application module and using its forRoot method to
define the routing configuration.

    -> The provideRouter method enables us to use a set of Angular artifacts related to routing:
        • Services to perform common routing tasks such as navigation
        • Directives that we can use in our components to enrich them with navigation logic
    
    -> It accepts a single parameter, which is the routing configuration of the application, and is
        defined by default in the app.routes.ts file.
