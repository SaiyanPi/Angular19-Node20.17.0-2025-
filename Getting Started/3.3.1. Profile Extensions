VSCode Profile Extensions:

- Let's explore some of the extensions in the VSCode Angular profile.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Angular Language Service:

- The Angular Language Service extension is developed and maintained by the Angular team and 
    provides code completion, navigation, and error detection inside Angular templates. It enriches 
    VSCode with the following features:
    • Code completion
    • A go-to definition
    • Quick info
    • Diagnostic messages

- To get a glimpse of its powerful capabilities, let’s look at the code completion feature. Suppose 
    we want to display a new property called description in the template of the main component. 
    We can set this up by going through the following steps:

    1) Define the new property in the app.component.ts file:

        // omitted
        export class AppComponent {
            title = 'MyApp';
            description = 'This is my Angular app.';
        }
    
    2) Open the app.component.html file and add the property name in the template using Angular
        interpolation syntax. The Angular Language Service will find it and suggest it for us
        automatically:
        (see AngularLanguageService.png)

- The description property is a public property. We can omit the keyword public when using public 
    properties and methods.
-   Code completion does not work for private properties and methods. If the property had been declared
    private, then the Angular Language Service and the template would not have been able to recognize it.

# Material Icon Theme:

- VSCode has a built-in set of icons to display different types of files in a project. The Material Icon 
    Theme extension provides additional icons that conform to the Material Design guidelines by Google;
    a subset of this collection targets Angular-based artifacts:

- Using this extension, you can easily spot the type of Angular files in a project, such as components, 
    and increase developer productivity, especially in large projects with many files.

# EditorConfig:

-  VSCode editor settings, such as indentation or spacing, can be set at a user or project level.
    EditorConfig can override these settings using the .editorconfig configuration file, which can be 
    found in the root folder of an Angular CLI project:
    (.editorconfig)

        # Editor configuration, see https://editorconfig.org
        root = true

        [*]
        charset = utf-8
        indent_style = space
        indent_size = 2
        insert_final_newline = true
        trim_trailing_whitespace = true

        [*.ts]
        quote_type = single
        ij_typescript_use_double_quotes = false

        [*.md]
        max_line_length = off
        trim_trailing_whitespace = false

    -> You can define unique settings in this file to ensure the consistency of the coding style across 
        your team.
